"geo:-34.4698592,-57.8433679?q=Colonia del Sacramento&u=30","If you are in Buenos Aires and want to get away from all the noise, this small town is the perfect place for a day of relax and history. Disputed between the Spanish and Portuguese Crowns until almost the end of the XVIII century, it is the perfect plan for a day (by boat from Bs As or car/bus from Montevideo), where you can see the colonial architecture and enjoy the food and the sun. Make sure to check the Raddisson Hotel's pool if it is too warm! :D"
"geo:-34.5940268,-58.4469043?q=Bohemios&u=30","Almost all soccer clubs in Buenos Aires have restaurants: this is the typical Neighbourhood club restaurant in the city, where you will be able to grasp the neighbourhood culture and how much people care about their sports club - especially if they play soccer there! great food! good quality and very friendly staff! 

Not so good if you don't eat meat: they do not have so many options for vegetarians.  "
"geo:-41.0757505,-71.4764209?q=Cerro Campanario&u=30","Definitely one of the best views in Bariloche, you can reach the top of cerro Campanario either by foot (easy level hike) or cablecar - the ticket is around 3 EUR. Definetely worth it if you want to check the lakes around Bariloche and get an idea of the extension of The Andes. 

The Cerro is right at the start of ""Circuito Chico"": a 24km road through mountains full of hiking trails. So a good idea is always to wake up early, get to the top fo the mountain, and at around 11am start the Circuito."
"geo:-41.1350512,-71.2935964?q=La Fonda del Tío&u=30","Great place to try good plates that combines the best of Argentinian and Italian food tradition - good environment and really cheap. Try the ""milanesa"" if you eat meat and the ""canelones"" if you are a vegetarian. After 9pm you will need to queue, so make sure to either book in advance or go beforehand - and be careful: the sizes are really big! you can definitely share a portion.

Great for groups, families and friends, if you are looking for something romantic this is not the place to go.

"geo:-41.1982502,-71.4862753?q=Refugio Emilio Frey&u=30","Cool shelter located 1700mts high on the top of Cerro Catedral with an amazing 12km hike passing through forests, hills, and cliffs with the flowers and clear water. It has it all for the beginner hikers. Great in Spring/Summer seasons, when you can see the forest in between at its best. Make sure to take water and a walking stick along with some snacks for the way. The last hour can be tricky, as it is super steep. Wanna sleep/camp there? book in advance: http://refugiofreybariloche.com/"

Can only imagine how amazing it must be on a sunny day, with the lake around and the walls warmed by the sun. It was a fantastic experience to wander through its many rooms, and discover historical artifacts from its history spanning a whole millennium. Was touched by the story of François Bonivard who was imprisoned there and inspired a poem of Lord Byron: The Prisoner of Chillon. "
"geo:46.58674645,13.928256600000001?q=Apartments am See Domenig&u=30",Great place to work and to live!
"geo:46.8480544,9.530575?q=Gasthaus Gansplatz&u=30",Traditional restaurant with very good cuisine. The cordon bleus are recommended.
"geo:46.8532884,9.532565?q=Otello&u=30","If you search an Italian in Chur and you like pasta and pizza, this is the place for you. Good Italian just next to the train station! very friendly service and good pizza!"
"geo:46.9122292,17.8917574?q=Tihany&u=30","Cozy historical village on the Tihany peninsula on the northern shore of Lake Balaton. Very well maintained and a real tourist magnet for the whole of Hungary. The village's website offers a downloadable pocket guide, a video and even a virtual tour. Besides the beautiful landscape one can enjoy the relics of the folk architecture such as the peasant houses. Had a great traditional meal at the Gulyas Udvar Etterem. Might become very crowded during high season (in March it was perfect though)."
"geo:46.9128657,17.8881952?q=Gulyás Udvar Étterem&u=30","Had lunch here during our visit of Tihany, a picturesque historical village on a peninsula of Lake Balaton. This restaurant might look very touristic from outside, but inside you find a truly traditional cozy place that serves simple and very well-made local food, such as the cod paprikas I had. The waiter was very engaged and pleasant, and helped us to find the right meal according to our tastes. It was a great experience."
"geo:46.9470165,7.437509?q=Starbucks&u=30",Very close to the train station. Good but expensive coffee.
"geo:47.0002812,8.3983246?q=Bürgenstock&u=30","Bürgenstock is great for a day trip from Zurich, Luzern or Zug. Nice trails on top for walks, and amazing view over alps and Lake Lucerne. Also, quite a few fine dining restaurants around, as well as a spa."

"geo:47.0511141,8.29512?q=Gütsch&u=30","We hiked up to Gütsch on a winter afternoon when it was already getting dark. Had a beautiful view over Lucerne from there. The restaurant also looks very nice, but didn't have the time to visit it. 
Next time we will definitely visit the little sculpture park there as it seemed interesting (closes at 18:00). For the way down we took the little funicular. Definitely recommend for a day trip to Luzern."
"geo:47.1437602,8.5337843?q=Zugerberg&u=30","Nice destination for a hike up from the town of Zug. Hike takes around 2 hours and gives a beautiful view on the Zuger lake. On top there is a restaurant with simple local food to enjoy before hiking back down again. Good views on the alps, on some days you can even see Eiger, Jungfrau and Mönch.
"
"geo:47.1671127,8.5157744?q=Juan Long&u=30","A Chinese restaurant in the heart of Zug, Suan Long is a good place for a meal and a beer with friends. Food is good but not amazing, and there are no original vegetarian dishes, but rather the type of options where meat was replaced with tofu. Staff is friendly but often looks tired. It can be quite smoky inside due to the open kitchen where a lot of frying is going on."
"geo:47.1674468,8.5149937?q=Gotthärdli&u=30","I regularly eat at this fantastic Thai restaurant. They have a bar downstairs which the restaurant shouldn't be confused with. The food is pretty authentic and there are sufficient vegetarian options. The restaurant is located in a historic and well kept house that displays original wood covered walls, with windows towards the lake. A pleasure for the eye as well."

"geo:47.1718112,8.5137931?q=Reformierte Kirche&u=30","Visited a wonderful organ concert in this church on Sunday 2nd Feb. The concert took place on the organ-gallery, a loft that can be reached over stairs. I was impressed with the acoustics and the quality of the performance. Learned later that the church has been designated to cultural and spiritual events, and as a place for community gatherings, under the name CityKircheZug. Will definitely visit other cultural events here in the future."
"geo:47.1725513,8.5181721?q=Cha Cha Thai&u=30","Funky interior, but low quality food. Sauces for rice dishes often contain only meat without any vegetable and noodle dishes do not have much taste. Better food and prices at Gotthärdli am See thai restaurant."
"geo:47.1850241,8.5178011?u=50&q=Lidl","Great place to do essentials shopping, but also some nice extras like good cheese and wine selection. Rarely too crowded, reasonable prices and constantly introduce new inventory. Can be lacking in more specialist products or general household items, but for that other shops like large Coop are better."

"geo:47.3615349,8.5151166?q=piqyourdress Showroom Zurich&u=30","After visiting many traditional wedding clothing shops, piqyourdress was an absolute delight! They have a modern and minimalist concept, offering a manageable selection of modular pieces that can be combined according to one's taste for styles, colours, and materials.
The atmosphere in the showroom was great: lots of space and daylight to try different combinations. Ramona was patient in helping me with the dresses, and she spread such a positive and tranquil vibe. I'll definitely come back to try some evening wear as well."
"geo:47.3762816,8.5386097?q=roots&u=30","Very good food! Light and high quality bowls, refined seasoning. Food was ready within less than 10 minutes, and was served in beautiful artesian bowls. Good atmosphere "
"geo:47.3807554,8.5040594?q=Brasserie Nestor&u=30","We had the two vegetarian options on the menu and they were both very interesting and refined dishes. A bit too much grains for us, especially in the mushroom porridge, but nevertheless balanced and interesting tastes. Atmosphere also nice with large glass windows and a minimalist retro decor."
"geo:47.3869001,8.5170453?q=Maag MusicHall&u=30",Visited the Van Gogh Alive exhibition at Maag yesterday. Great experience in terms of sound and light quality. From the outside and also inside the building could benefit from modernisation to make it more welcoming.

"geo:47.4866113,19.058951711704644?q=Great Market Hall&u=30","Large historic indoor market in Budapest, built in 1897 and renovated in 1997. The architecture alone is already worth a visit. Very nice to wander around the many food stalls with local produce or popular Hungarian food items, eateries, souvenir shops."
"geo:47.486916,19.044562?q=Gellért Hill&u=30","It is a very nice walk up Gellert Hill, through a large park with windy paths and sculptures along the way. On top, you have a fantastic view over Budapest. A variety of stalls offering drinks and snacks makes it a great afternoon or early evening tour, especially on a warm and sunny day."
"geo:47.4893769,19.0536298?q=Kahwa el Salam&u=30","We went here for breakfast and it turned out to be a real hidden gem in terms of coziness and beautiful interior. Food was ok, we had an omelette with pickled veggies, topped with grated cheese. The regular omelette without the pickles is probably better. Service was very nice and the atmosphere was relaxed and cheerful. "
"geo:47.4925461,19.0607007?q=Budapest Baristas&u=30","Went here for breakfast and loved the food! Creative vegetarian/vegan options. Had dishes with oven-roasted pumpkin and another one with sweet potato, topped with different veggies or eggs/salmon. The coffee was great, too. Interior is cozy and interesting with the gallery, but overall quite small. At some point there was a queue of people ordering directly at the counter, which filled up the whole room."
"geo:47.4974858,19.0627583?q=Gettó Gulyás&u=30","Great restaurant serving traditional gulyas and paprikas. Elegant and cozy industrial-style interior. Had two vegetarian dishes: one with giant white beans, topped with a fried egg and fresh peppers and onions that was fantastic. Second dish was good, but the mushrooms were a bit watery, so it was not as great as the bean dish. Great white wine recommendation (Tokaji) that fit perfectly. "
"geo:47.5052599,19.0722363?q=Napfényes étterem&u=30",Nice vegan restaurant serving vegan versions of traditional Hungarian meals and more. Great for anyone who wants to explore the local cuisine without meat. Interior was well-maintained but looked a bit old-fashioned. But the food and great service made up for it.
"geo:47.5605517,10.2166885?q=Freilich Unverpackt&u=30",Super friendly stuff and excelent coffee! A great initiative to support sustainable shopping for organic and regional food and other products by reducing packaging and plastic.

Too corporate.
Uber cliquey.

Growing and changing a lot.
I feel like a little more openness to establishing connections with different people is all this area actually needs. "

One of the rooms often have Artwork for sale, which is a collaboration between RÅG and local artists. There are some good vegan options but if RÅG wants a 5 star rating from me, they need to expand those options further. Also the coffee could be a little better. The staff are nice people and have given me free dessert on several occasions."
